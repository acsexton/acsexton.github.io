Hi! I'm Andrew, a deep-thinker and dedicated take-stuff-apart-and-put-it-back-together-better-er, and I'm starting a career in software engineering.

After getting a degree in [Philosophy](https://www.wcu.edu/learn/departments-schools-colleges/cas/humanities/pardept/index.aspx) with some heavy creative emphasis, I learned enough as hospital help desk guy (and [part-time club DJ / mashup artist](https://soundcloud.com/barrowlights/tracks)) to become a pretty solid Healthcare Information Systems Analyst. While working through a couple short stories, I decided it was time to muscle up the [other half of my brain](https://www.britannica.com/story/are-there-really-right-brained-and-left-brained-people) and take a trip back to school for a bachelor's in [Computer Science](https://www.wcu.edu/learn/programs/computer-science/index.aspx).

I've always been a learn-by-doing person, especially when it involves computers. From straightforward projects (building this site with Jekyll on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)) to the contrived ("difficult to program, easy to read" is the mantra of the WCU CS department), I just really like solving problems with code. 

And, now that I've spent years of my life figuring out what I want to do and what I'm good at, I'm interested in making money again.

So, on that note, once more: Hi! I'm Andrew.

If you (or someone you love) is responsible for a tech company's decisions, lots of things you might need to decide whether I might be worth sharing some of your resources are on [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/acsexton/). I also have [a github](https://github.com/acsexton/) and infrequently put some words about neat things [here]({% link pages/blurbs.html %}) and on [my twitter](https://twitter.com/ac_sexton).

Anything else you'd like to know, feel free to email me at andrew at acsexton dot com!
