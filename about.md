Hi! I'm Andrew.

I've always been a deep-thinker and taking-stuff-apart-er.

After getting a degree from [WCU's Philosophy and Religion department](https://www.wcu.edu/learn/departments-schools-colleges/cas/humanities/pardept/index.aspx) (minoring in writing), I became a help desk guy at Harris Regional Hospital/LifePoint (and [part-time club DJ](https://soundcloud.com/barrowlights/tracks)...unfortunately not mixing beats at the hospital).

After a while, I earned a promotion to Healthcare Information Systems Analyst and started doing department-to-hospital-wide project implementations and working with the system admins to clean up some old loose ends we found. A little under two years later, they brought my position back to company headquarters so we split on good terms. I used my okay-you're-done-now-package to start tuition on a bachelor's in Computer Science (minoring in math), again [at WCU](https://www.wcu.edu/learn/programs/computer-science/index.aspx).

So that's where we are now. 

My school time is spent trying not to obsess over how a different structure would ease up whatever contrived linked list project I've been given (it likely wouldn't, my professors are *thorough*).

My free time is primarily used for debating `opinions` in the Philosophy office (as an alum, I get to use the office fridge) or, at my chair near the big CS Lab window, debating what kind of drinking buddy a given data structure would be (I think maybe Hash Tables would be the coolest, depending on what language they spoke). 

I could only be more happy if they paid me.

So, on that note, again: Hi! I'm Andrew.

Lots of things you might need to know about me to decide whether I'm worth a percentage of your company's time and money are on [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/acsexton/). I also have [a github](https://github.com/acsexton/) and infrequently put some words about neat things on [my twitter](https://twitter.com/ac_sexton).

Anything else you need to know, feel free to email me at andrew at acsexton dot com.
