It’s 2010. Trip with friends and we’re at a gas station. I volunteer to go get snacks. I have no cash in hand and $6 on my debit card. 
Pete wants a $3 Coke and gives me a $5 bill.
Davis wants $2 Combos and a $4 Red Bull and gives me a $10. 
What bill(s) do I give the guy at the register and who gets what change?

#### Answer: ####

Put it all on my debit card, tell them both to buy me a beer when we get where we’re going, and call the bank and beg for an overdraft penalty refund once it posts. Since Davis is a Sophomore, we’ll make him go get our snacks at every stop from here on. 

### Problem solved. ###

Don’t get me wrong, I like treating people, but numbers, man.

As [I mentioned before](https://acsexton.github.io/posts/beginagin/), I didn’t do so hot in highschool math. So I hit college in 2007 knowing some 8th-grade algebra, solving super-simple problems for 'x' and reciting the pythagorean theorem (not that I could actually *use* it). Studying philosophy, I focused on what makes sense to people and why. Felt like I dodged a bullet when I found out I could just take "History of Numbers" and be done with math for good. Still, it was a long while before I began to do well in the required formal logic work, but eventually those went *okay*, my papers started to have real structure, and I did decently overall. 

All that said, still, when I look back at the language in earlier posts on this site, it’d be easy to assume I was making a bigger deal out of all of this than it was.

But, you have to understand, I was choosing a path that I spent my whole life thinking I would fail.

I wasn't made for this at all.

I had to make myself for this. 

#### It was the biggest deal. ####

For me, words are warmth and truth and understanding and comfort. And I was putting them on the backburner to pursue what I felt was the sanitary-est and abstract-est of sanitary abstractions: taking up Computer Science in the name of business and economic trend.

And let’s be real: it’s not like somewhere in the last year was there a point I experienced a moment of self-discovery about math or anything. I never suddenly found out I was “good at it all along". The calculator did not turn out to be *[in my heart the whole time](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasWithYouAllAlong)*, and the credits have yet to roll -- I still have integral calc to finish and multivariable calc to start.

I failed a **constantly** at the start.

But more importantly: I failed **consistently**. 

And much, much more importantly: I learned how to learn from my mistakes. (More on that sometime soon.)

But I guess I’m finally on the right track, ‘cause after a year of work, here's how the first semester went:

| :--: |
| *What even* is *a Dean's List?* |

### So About that Progress ###

This time last year, I would not have comprehended the slope of a line if you had given me the wikipedia page for 'slope' and paid me to try to work it out. 

`y = mx + b` meant nothing to me.

But about a month ago I found out I can find slopes of lines perpendicular to lines tangent to points on curves.

### So, got anything in mind that you think you can't do? ###

I’m gonna make a couple posts soon that will walk through how I learned my way up from extremely limited Algebra to Calc II in a year, but I’ll save some time and give you the general takeaway now:

Think of the last time you or someone close to you dropped the words “I’m bad at [x].” 

Common, right? 

But of the things you hope you’re good at, how often do you actually *feel* good at those things? How often do you talk to someone else who’s confidently (but not arrogantly) able to share that they’re “good at” something too? 

It’s uncommon at best, cocky and antisocial at worst.

Truth is we *like* to say we're bad at things. 

We know what we know, and when we *know* we cannot do something it may be better to spend our time and energy somewhere else. 

Fair enough.

But this is how we make a social practice out of not “wasting our time” learning things that didn’t come easy.

You could say it’s a … slippery slope. (Not sorry.)

Math is much less something to be studied than it is a skill to be developed. And that concept never quite connected for me until this year: just like any other skill, it requires repetition, review, and an open willingness for failure. 

It is absolutely impossible to teach someone (including yourself) something they *know* they cannot do. But it makes a world of difference when they’re willing to fail as many times as it takes to succeed.
