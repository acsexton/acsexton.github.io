[Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/) takes a program written in some language and shows how color-coded sections would be compiled into different kinds of assembly. I really enjoyed my assembly class (we used MIPS), and the way things look when you run `-O` as a compiler option gives me warm fuzzies.
