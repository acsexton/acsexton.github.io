May 2017, my position as Health Information Systems Analyst at the local hospital was eliminated by our recent corporate buyers.

I watched a lot of Westworld over the next few days, and spent a lot of time staring at the trees behind my house once that season was over.

And somewhere in that mix I decided that without any math skills or history of programming, I'd see about going back to school full time for a Computer Science degree.

So one morning, I Googled the extremely sensible:

```
things I wish I knew computer science major graduate
```

and opened every link on the first three pages of results. The next couple of days were full of Quora, Stack Exchange, Reddit, blogs, school news, articles... Then once I was finished with the basics, I filtered through the book and article recommendations that popped up in *those*...

I put together a timeline with goals and absolute deadlines, dredged a non-graphing TI-36X up from the black pits of the *are-you-sure-you-don't-mean-to-buy-a-ti-83* internet.

I figured if I could make it through while my savings held out, I could apply for school in the Spring and then start living on student loans as needed.

* [MITx: 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-10)
* [Arizona State University MAT170: Precalculus](https://www.edx.org/course/precalculus-asux-mat170x)

And I got to work.

And then I finished all of the courses.

And then I applied.

And I was accepted.

# Winter Has Come

School proper starts soon, and I'm taking plenty of moments to try and figure whether I'm even half as prepared as I think I am. The MITx course blew my head up, and combined with the math work, I think I've done more problem solving in the last eight months than I did in The Before-Times&trade; combined. 

Of course, there has been plenty of doubt, plenty of "YOUR SERVICE IS ENDING PLEASE CALL..." forms, so many hours spent on the porch with [Khan Academy](http://khanacademy.org/), and too much time thinking too hard about too many things while the rest of the world slept. 

But through it all, I have been amazed to find people have been willing to stay awake through my repeated, exceedingly-whelmed, badly worded tirades, my `short diversions` into `mild concern`. 

And I'm as grateful as a person can be.

But preparing myself for this has absolutely been among the hardest things I've ever done. It changed all of my priorities and everything about the way I live (including some of the ways I speak about it) and I've really struggled to keep up. No matter how this all turns out in the end, I feel like even just these past ~7 months of small steps has plenty of lessons for its own degree. 

I'm about ready as I'll ever be.

#### But still... ####

I haven't taken a real classroom math course since Algebra 2 in 10th grade and I'm terrified.

I mean, also I failed that *and* the following year and had to do it over Summer school before senior year, so as a letters person knowing I'll have to do well in Calculus II in about two semesters, I am, again, *mildly concerned*. 

But I have to admit, there's a part of me that's extremely proud, knowing that I've asked for it and done everything I could to prepare.

Whether we choose to take risks or not, things change. And for reasons unknown, things tend to change very suddenly.

So if you ever really feel stagnant, take heart in knowing you're probably just seriously overlooking something awful -- if you ever see an opportunity for better, you might as well take it seriously, right?

Do what *you* think is best.

Put your goals in front of your worries.

And if you don't have any goals, stop being boring and get some.

I'm gonna go get my books on Saturday and see about taking a couple steps forward on my new path. Let me know about your struggles and we'll share `mild concerns`.
