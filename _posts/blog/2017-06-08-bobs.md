I just killed 40 minutes on an assignment that counts the number of times "bob" shows up in any given random string of characters:

```python
s = str("azcbobobegghabobkl")
count = 0
iterations = 0
start = 0
end = 3
while iterations < len(s):
    test = s[start:end]
    # print(test)
    iterations += 1
    start += 1
    end += 1
    if test == str("bob"):
        count += 1
print("Number of times bob occurs is: " + str(count))
```

I don't know if my solution could be any *less* elegant, it doesn't account for capital letters or other symbols, but it feels amazing to have made something that works.

And, hey, I can only go up from here.

However, there's a "If you've spent more than a few hours on this..." disclaimer on the next problem, so I'm just gonna go ahead, re-re-re-read the acceptance letter I received today, and celebrate officially being a tentative returning student for the Computer Science program at WCU starting Spring 2018.

Let's hope I can do a bit more than count some bobs by the time January rolls around.

Cheers!
