It’s 2010. Friends and I are at a gas station. I volunteer to get snacks. I have no cash and $6 on my card. 
Pete wants a $3 Coke and gives me a $5 bill.
Davis wants $2 Combos and a $4 Red Bull and gives me a $10. 
What bill(s) do I give the guy at the register and who gets what change?

#### Answer: ####

Put it all on my debit card, tell them both to buy me a beer when we get where we’re going, and call the bank and beg for an overdraft penalty refund once it posts. Since Davis is a Sophomore, we’ll make him go get our snacks at every stop from here on. 

### Problem solved. ###

Don’t get me wrong, I like treating people, but numbers, man.

I hit college in 2007 knowing some 8th-grade algebra. *Some*. I was more into learning about what makes sense to people and why. I felt like I dodged a bullet when I found out I could just take Math 103, something like "History of Numbers", and be done with math credits for good. Sure, Philosophy's logic courses hurt, but with some effort, those cleared up, my papers started to have real structure, and I did decently overall. 

Still, I'm sure it's easy to assume I've been making a bigger deal out of math than it was.

But, you have to understand, I knowingly chose a path that I spent my whole life believing I would fail.

#### It was the biggest deal. ####

Words are warmth and truth and understanding and comfort. And it's not like there a point I experienced a moment of self-discovery where I suddenly loved math or anything. I never suddenly found out I was “good at it all along", never "discovered my gift", and the calculator has certainly not turned out to be *[in my heart the whole time](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasWithYouAllAlong)*. 

I started these classes and I failed **constantly**. I can't express how discouraging it was when I realized you certainly don't get better at math by not trying for 12 years.

But I pressed on. And through failing **consistently**, I started to get better.

And I guess I’m finally on the right track, ‘cause after a year of work, here's how the first semester went:

| :--: |
| *What even* is *a Dean's List?* |



This time last year, I could not find the slope of a line.

And about a month ago I found out I can find slopes of lines perpendicular to lines tangent to points on curves:

### So, tell me about a thing you think you can't do. ###

Think of the last time you or someone close to you dropped the words “I’m bad at [x].” 

But of the things you hope you’re good at, how often do you actually *feel* good at those things? How often do you talk to someone else who’s able to share that they’re “good at” something too? 

Why do we seem to *like* to say we're bad at things?

We make a social practice out of not learning things that don't come easy. This is how we forget how okay it is to be wrong, to fail, how fun it can be to be bad at something *until we're good at it*.

Math is much less something to be studied than it is a skill to be developed. Just like any other skill, it requires repetition, review, and (especially when you're a words-person) a pretty serious tolerance for failure. 

It may be impossible to teach someone something they *know* they cannot do, even if that person is yourself. 

But it makes a world of difference when they’re willing to fail as many times as it takes to succeed.

Pick your direction. And show up to walk it until you're where you wanted to be.
