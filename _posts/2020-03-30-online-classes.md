A friend of mine is learning to code, and the time is simply not there for something like a [full Open Source CS Study Plan](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). Continuing the search, I found [this really nice quick rundown](https://github.com/mvillaloboz/open-source-cs-degree) of useful online courses for learning what programming's about, but a good few of the programs are down or their delivery methods are a little out of date. So I got to work on some replacements.

The goals here are to emphasize fundamentals and make the most of available time to get the greatest exposure to problems and practice.

You're obviously more than welcome to add your own coursework as you find it, but consistent strong output beats the crap out of "do everything at once" every time.

## Prerequisite 1
Focus on one of these courses on its own at a time. Feel free to move on after one's complete (or come back for it sometime later).

If you do choose to do the other, consider starting Prereq 2 alongside it.
 
* [Introduction to Computer Science (using C): Harvard](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science)
* [Introduction to Computer Science (using Python): MITx](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7)

## Prerequisite 2
Again, consider trying to focus on this on its own, but if this is going smoothly for you a week or two in, start up Term 1.

* [Data Structures: UC San Diego](https://www.edx.org/course/data-structures-fundamentals)

## Term 1
* [Algorithm Specialization: Stanford](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms)
* [Computer Architecture: MITx](https://www.edx.org/course/computation-structures-2-computer-mitx-6-004-2x)

## Term 2
* [Web Development: University of Pennsylvania](https://www.edx.org/course/programming-for-the-web-with-javascript)
* [Relational Databases / SQL: Indiana University](https://www.edx.org/course/enterprise-data-management)
* Pick an Elective from Below

## Term 3
* [Programming Languages and Compilers: Stanford](https://www.edx.org/course/compilers)
* [Introduction to Networking: NYU](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-networking)
* [Operating Systems: GA Tech](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-operating-systems--ud923)
* Gain some soft skills and critical approaches:
  * Read [Clean Coder](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073) and 
  * [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) 
* Pick an Elective from Below

## Electives
* [Computer Graphics: UC San Diego](https://www.edx.org/course/computer-graphics-2)
* [UX Design: Google](https://www.udacity.com/course/ux-design-for-mobile-developers--ud849)
* [Mobile App Development with React: Harvard](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-mobile-app-development-with-react-native)
* [Android Development: University of Maryland](https://www.coursera.org/learn/android-programming)
* [iOS Development](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-ios-app-development-with-swift--ud585)
