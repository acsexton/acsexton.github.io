# Oh. Okay, yeah, that's cool.

You get a job, you do the budget, and you start saving a couple months' worth of pay in the *off chance* you one day are told you can't come back tomorrow.

Then, five years later, HR calls you to an orientation classroom and tells you in front of your manager and director that corporate is absorbing your responsibilities, here is your severance package and unemployment info could you please return for your personal stuff at 6pm tonight.

You nod and smile, thank them for the opportunities over the years and for their time today and wonder for a second if this means you need to get a haircut now and what your mom will say.

Someone escorts you back to your office just to grab your bag, old work buddies avoid eye contact, you notice your work laptop's already gone, and you drive off to lug the burden home.

You tell your partner, you have a couple drinks while you change your passwords and refresh the same "recent activity" Google page five times before you call it done, turn on a movie you can't really focus on, and day one of the *"between"* is over before you're ready.

You wake up blurry, startled to notice how much your morning routine relied on needing to be somewhere, and stumble back through your old budget spreadsheet. You've forgotten abbreviations you thought would make total sense later, but you run your balances, rack your brain for any upcoming credit card posts, regret some recent extragvagance, and sigh when you finally see you'd definitely managed to save yourself into a little time to breathe.

So you do.

You resume activity an hour later, unsure if you were staring at a wall or sleeping -- not that it matters -- before you, with a a determined nod, search for old jobhunt emails that would be in first grade if they were children, drag yourself to LinkedIn to update and end that position without being too obvious, and you do your best to "endorse" a couple friends hoping they'll do the same.

You go through the motions for a few days to try and build a new routine, updating a Word document to keep track of your applications, alternatively searching for more postings nearby and seeing more spots on the walls you've never noticed. You find a few openings asking way more than yours needed and some others offering a bit less than yours did. So, simultaneously insecure of your knowledge and prideful over your position, you grin and bear the limbo while sweating out resume edits, and you keep churning cover letters while hoping for the best.

Then another week passes. After a good evening out with friends, you find another moment to breathe and you're struck by a best possible next action on one of those old projects. And that's when it **really** hits you:

You're done there. You'll never go back to that desk, pick up that phone, log into that PC, attend any of those calls, drop by any of those meetings... That project you drove so hard for so long is no longer yours. And the part of you that knows "money is freedom" starts to tell you that you shouldn't have even gone out tonight and shouldn't you have heard from that one company by now and God I bet your cover letter made you sound like an idiot, and bit by bit, your life starts to feel like it's less yours too.

# Turning point.

But in tech, before you go thinking something is broken, you know you should always restart.

So do so. Reboot.

From the start.

> Why were you there in the first place?

Well, uh, I blew my chances with math in highschool so I picked up a degree in Philosophy with a minor in English. Fell backwards into IT support after eight months of unemployment failing to justify grad school.

> Hobby. Why?

Because computers make sense to me, and people kinda do too. Dogs love to be smart. Cats love to be smart. People, on the other hand, are almost always willing to do the smartest thing that's *easiest* for them, but we'll put in those hours doing dumb stuff too. And even though I kinda liked computers, I did plenty of dumb stuff as well to get that good.

> Well, where did you put in those hours?

I am no stranger to banging on a keyboard at 3:30am willing git to let me sync except I'd cloned into what I'd later realize was a symlink to my Dropbox which had confused my repo...

> Maybe try to discern something intelligent from the breakdown?

Ok.

I want to, at least a little, help break down the barrier of entry to a more open world of information, making ideas and data available to those who, just a few years ago, may not have even been able to get any of it.

I want to learn to script, to automate, to get a computer to not just understand but intuit meaning from people who struggle to get that meaning out.

I want to help make computers accessible and applications open and easy, and I want to give a kid who grew up confused by some stuff like me the opportunity to feel what feeling smart for once feels like.

So I started the research.

# Gotime.

I Googled the maybe undeniably sensible `things wish know knew computer science major graduate`, indiscriminately opened the entire contents of the first three pages of returns, and started reading everything there. Quora, stack exchange, reddit, blogs, school news, articles, the works. Taking notes. Dividing it all up and synthesizing what I found, I could see more and more that the things I get about people and the things I know about computers might make a decent pair.

I built a timeline, I wrote down goals and deadlines, I dredged a non-graphing calculator up from the black pits of some very are-you-sure-you-don't-mean-to-buy-a-ti-83 online retailers, and I signed up for some online courses to make up for the fact that I never paid any attention in math and don't know a whole lot of anything about code.

* [MAT117 College Algebra and Problem Solving hosted by Arizona State University](https://www.edx.org/course/college-algebra-problem-solving-asux-mat117x)
* [MITx: 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-10)

And I submitted my application to start Computer Science as a returning student in Spring 2018.

So, even though I started out only able to answer 5% of the questions offered on the Math intro exam, I'm now halfway through the course and on track to finish in just under another month. Then it's on to the related [pre-calculus course](https://www.edx.org/course/precalculus-asux-mat170x) and hopefully finishing simultaneously with the CompSci intro as August begins.

Having no experience with code, I'm at a disadvantage, but I have plenty of resources for independent study, personal projects to practice on, friends and colleagues establishing themselves well in the industry, and the benefit of 5 years experience in healthcare IT at an analyst level.

But, meantime, I'll keep on keeping on, review, practice, study, get a part time job to feed the bills when I've finished this first run of courses, then hit the ground running in January as a full-time student.

For once, things make sense. For once it feels like I'm on track to do something better, to take my passions for interaction and sharing information and people and computers all somewhere bundled and ready to engage whatever's next.

This feels right.

Let's go.
