# Semester One: Done.

I made it through a chemistry professor who had no business teaching, group projects with people who were 10 when I bought this backpack, and my first discussions of slope/intercept form in 12 years.
It wasn't easy, but I can definitely see this through.

It's been a year and everything is green again. I still don't feel like I have much to show for the code yet, but I'm always looking out, and this summer will start stacking it on through exercises and a course on java.
