Since we're doing good bad and ugly here, figure it doesn't get much uglier than my first run of exercises. Just killed 40 minutes working on a program that will take some arbitrary input and count the number of times "bob" shows up in it.

Capital letters, punctuation, sensible sentences be damned, we're just working with the lower case dudes in a single group right now.

It's rudimentary and more than likely horribly inefficient and messy (not that I have much to compare to) but good lord, let me tell you, seeing this pump out the right number of "bob"s in the given bunch and a couple others was dang satisfying.

```python
# Assume s is a string of lower case characters.
# Write a program that prints the number of times the string 'bob' occurs in s.
# For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your program should print
# Number of times bob occurs is: 2

s = str("azcbobobegghakl")
count = 0
iterations = 0
start = 0
end = 3
while iterations < len(s):
    test = s[start:end]
    # print(test)
    iterations += 1
    start += 1
    end += 1
    if test == str("bob"):
        count += 1
print("Number of times bob occurs is: " + str(count))
```

Next problem has an "If you've spent more than a few hours on this problem," disclaimer, so for now, I'm just gonna have a celebration whiskey and enjoy the moment.

Also, received the acceptance letter for the Computer Science program at WCU. So there's another reason to enjoy. (Not that I was horribly worried, that would've just kinda put an awesomely huge damper on some things.)

So, crisis averted. itshappening. Let's hope I can do a bit more than count some bobs by the time January rolls around.

Cheers.
