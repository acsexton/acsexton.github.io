Okay. So. Since the 'bob'-counter there has been so much more code-learnin'. And, God, I didn't know 10 digits + 26 letters (and a few we borrowed) could cause so many problems. Over the last eight months I've done more math and coding than I think I did up to that point (**AND I LIKED IT**) and now Winter has come and man I hope I'm prepared as I think I am.

It's been real. 

There has been no shortage of doubt. No shortage of "YOUR SERVICE IS ENDING PLEASE CALL..." forms and no shortage of time to think too hard about too many things. But man some ridiculously cool people have been willing to stay awake through my obnoxious jabbering, and for that I'm about as thankful as one can be.

Learning what I have has taken a lot of adjustments to the way I live, the things I choose to look for in the world and even some of the ways I speak about it. Regardless of how any of this goes, a year of baby steps through a sometimes dark patch of forest is probably about the best way I've spent such time. And here at the edge of the next path I'm ready to see what it all looks like.

That said, I haven't taken a real classroom math course since Algebra 2 in 11th grade. 

"lol i'm bad at math too" Yeah okay but I failed it and it was my *second* try.

(And if you were in kindergarten the first time I failed it, you could be one of my Freshman classmates this year. **Hrng.**) 

As a letters person looking at knowing I'll have to do well in Calc 2 a little over a year from now, there aren't a whole lot of bigger concerns. But the only difference between this and any other sort of terrifying life event is that I've *asked* for this.

Whether we take a risk or not, things change. And they like to do so suddenly. If you ever really feel stagnant, take heart in knowing you're either ignoring the obvious, lying to yourself, or something's coming just around the corner for ya, so if you see anything like an opportunity for something better, you might as well take charge and do what *you* think is best.

Put your goals in front of your worries. 

If you don't have any, stop being boring and get some.

I'm gonna go get my books on Saturday and start walking that new path.

Feel free to start walking a new one with me.
