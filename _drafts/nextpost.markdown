# "Spring" Semester Starts Tuesday.

Getting way more of-da-norf vibes out there right now though. Winter has definitely come and man I hope I'm as prepared as I think I am.

But I've got Arizona State's Algebra and Pre-Cal curriculum behind me and after a couple meetings with the head of the department, I'm only mostly terrified.

Also there was MIT's Introduction to Computer Science with Python, a couple projects poked at, and I've coded more since May than ever before in my life. **AND I LIKE IT**.

It was a summer and fall full of baby steps. 

This is a big ol' jump.

But I'm ready to see how it goes.

# Some Math

It's been 10 years since my first Japanese class.
I haven't taken a proper math course since 11th grade.
If I'd started kindergarden then, I'd be a senior in highschool.

Hrng.

Ok, here's the thing. If there's a word for being on the precipice of risk knowing that everything changes in a few days and even though the universe doesn't care at all about you or what it is that you want out of life, you're gonna do it anyway, it's "life".

Because whether you start the risk or not, things change. If they don't feel like they are, you're just not paying enough attention.

So take charge and do what *you* think is best.

I go get my books on Saturday and make the first jump on my new path.

Feel free to start a new one with me.
