You notice helpdesk’s already grabbed your old pal, ITLaptop05, and something about that feels weird. You drive slow home, your car lugging a little under the burden but mostly because you’re not in a great headspace and forgot to shift back into third before this hill.<p>You tell your partner, you have a couple drinks, you turn on a movie you can’t really focus on and halfway through you remember you hadn’t logged out of anything before they took that laptop, so there’s that. You spend the rest of the movie changing your passwords for everything you might have been able to access at work and refresh the same “recent activity” Google page five, six, seven times… You decide you’re being paranoid and it’s 11:30pm – not that it matters – they probably wiped it by now anyway. You blink and stare at the TV and wait for day .5 of being <em>“in-between jobs”</em> to be over.<p>You try to convince yourself it’s a kind of summer vacation.<p>It kind of works.<p>You kind of sleep.<h1 id="day-one">Day One</h1><p>You wake up blurry, startled to notice how much your morning routine relied on needing to be somewhere, and after a couple hours you manage to find your old money-budget-saving spreadsheet. You’ve forgotten abbreviations you thought would make total sense later, but struggle through them, run your balances, rack your brain for any upcoming credit card posts, regret some recent extravagance, and finally nod when you see you’d definitely managed to save yourself into a little time to breathe.<p>So you do.<p>You resume activity sometime later, unsure if you spent the last hour staring at a wall or dozing – not that it matters – before you, with a a determined nod, search for old jobhunt emails (that would be in kindergarten if they were children), drag yourself to LinkedIn to update and end that position without being too obvious, and you do your best to “endorse” a couple friends hoping they’ll do the same.<p>You go through the motions for a few days to try and build a new routine, updating a Word document to keep track of your applications, alternately searching for more postings nearby and seeing more spots on the walls you’ve never noticed. You find a few openings asking way more than yours needed and some others offering a bit less than yours did. So, simultaneously insecure of your knowledge and prideful over your position, you grin and bear the limbo while sweating out resume edits, churning cover letters that you can’t tell make you seem too needy or maybe passive? Your cat provides no useful feedback.<p>Then another week passes. After a good evening out with friends, you’re struck by a best possible next action on one of those old projects. And that’s when it <strong>really</strong> hits you.<p>You’re done there. You’ll never go back to that desk, pick up that phone, log into that PC, attend any of those calls, drop by any of those meetings… That project you drove so hard for so long is no longer yours. And the part of you that knows “money is freedom” starts to tell you that you shouldn’t have even gone out tonight and shouldn’t you have heard from that one company by now and God I bet your cover letter made you sound like an idiot you should have listened to your cat, and bit by bit, your life starts to feel like it’s less yours too.<p>But in tech, before you go thinking something is broken, you know you should always restart.<p>So do so.<h1 id="reboot">Reboot</h1><blockquote><p>Why were you there in the first place?</blockquote><p>I blew my chances with math in highschool so I picked up a degree in Philosophy with a minor in English. Fell back on my computer repair hobby into IT support after eight months of unemployment and repeated failures to justify the cost of grad school.<blockquote><p>Hobby. Why?</blockquote><p>Because computers make sense to me, and people kinda do too. Dogs love to be smart. Cats love to be smart. People, on the other hand, are almost always willing to do the smartest thing that’s <em>easiest</em> for them, but we’ll put in those hours doing dumb stuff too. And even though I kinda liked computers, I did plenty of dumb stuff as well to get that good.<blockquote><p>Well, where did you put in those hours?</blockquote><p>I am no stranger to banging on a keyboard at 3:30am willing git to let me sync except I’d cloned into what I’d later realize was a symlink to my Dropbox which had confused my repo…<blockquote><p>Maybe try to pull something intelligent from this breakdown?</blockquote><p>Ok.<p>I want to, at least a little, help break down the barrier of entry to a more open world of information, making ideas and data available to those who, just a few years ago, may not have been able to get any of it.<p>I want to learn to script, to automate, to get a computer to not just understand but maybe even start to intuit meaning from people who struggle to get that meaning out.<p>I want to help make computers accessible and applications open and easy, and I want to give a kid who grew up confused by some stuff like me the opportunity to feel what feeling smart for once feels like.<h1 id="then-do-that">Then do that.</h1><p>So I started the research.<p>I Googled the maybe undeniably sensible<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">things wish know knew computer science major graduate</code><p>and indiscriminately opened each link on the first three pages of returns. It took me the next couple days to process it all. Quora, Stack Exchange, Reddit, blogs, school news, articles, the links in those articles, noting the books and article recommendations in the comment threads from <em>those</em>… Breaking it all down, I could see more and more that the things I get about people and the things I know about computers might blend somewhere if I try hard enough.<p>So I built a timeline, wrote down goals and deadlines, dredged a non-graphing calculator up from the black pits of some very <em>are-you-sure-you-don’t-mean-to-buy-a-ti-83</em> online retailers, and signed up for some online courses to make up for the fact that I haven’t done more than the bare minimum of code and never paid any attention in math. Then I got to work.<blockquote><p>The courses:<ul><li><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/college-algebra-problem-solving-asux-mat117x">Arizona State University MAT117: College Algebra and Problem Solving</a><li><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-10">MITx: 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python</a><li><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/precalculus-asux-mat170x">Arizona State University MAT170: Precalculus</a></ul></blockquote><p>Halfway through the college algebra course, once I saw math (probably) won’t try and kill me (yet), I sent in my application to start Computer Science as a returning student in Spring 2018.<p>Meantime I’ll keep on keeping on.<p>Review, practice, study, focus on living cheap and easy, and hit the ground running in January as a full-time student once again. Hopefully skilled enough in math by then to succeed in Calc I and enough in code to get trucking through till graduation with a decent amount of extracurricular projects under my belt, powering that good ol’ personal narrative.<p>I have plenty of resources for independent study and personal project ideas to practice on (which I’ll document here), incredibly supportive friends and colleagues in the industry, and the benefit of 5 years experience (everyone’s favorite entry level pre-requisite) in healthcare IT at an analyst level.<p>Good thoughts. Good things.<p>It’ll be interesting to see how it all turns out, but for now, things seem to make sense and I can breathe easy again. For now it feels like I’m on track to do something better, to take my passions for interaction and sharing information and people and computers, bundle ‘em all together, ready to engage whatever’s next.<p>This feels right.<p>So let’s go.<div class="post-links"> <a class="link-to-post" href="/posts/toomanybobs/"> <span class="link-to-post__next">&#10535; &nbsp;Next post</span> <span class="link-to-post__title">Step one</span> </a></div></div></article></main><footer class="blog-footer content-wrapper"><p>&copy; <span class="full-year"></span> Significent</footer><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script>
